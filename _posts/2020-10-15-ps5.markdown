set you back by 49,990 INR and for Digital Edition you have to pay 39,990 INR. 	

## Digital vs Standard Edition:	
lets understand how these two are different. before stepping into the further discussion the common difference between them is disc Drive .	
<span style="background-color: #FFFF99">  The First and most significant difference between them the standard edition comes with disc drive and digital edition is purely non disc. 	
  The digital version of ps5 is purely digital as it's name suggests, it wonâ€™t be compatible at all with games that come on a disc. In order to play games on the  ps5 digital edition  you have to download 	
the games from online stores including PS5 and PS4 games, DVDs, and 4K UHD Blu-ray movies.</span>	
one must consider that if you want to take advantage of free PS4 to PS5 upgrades, you'll need to use the PS5's disc drive to transfer physical PS4 games to the next-gen console.

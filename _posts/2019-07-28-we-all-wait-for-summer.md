>  AMP traffic uses different client IDs from those for web traffic by default. AMP pages load faster and show different traffic patterns than their standard web page counterparts, which can often mean you will get different metrics between AMP and non-AMP traffic.


# Three main Factors that plays vital Role in Amp projects:

# 1. Amp html code:

Most of the Tags Are Regular Tags although some Tags Are Replaced With amp Specific html Tags Those Powerful Tags Provides Performance And Optimization In Efficient Way.

``` javascript

<link rel="canonical" href="$SOME_URL"> tag inside their <head>

```

But Question Is How The Site Loads Faster Within A Sec Just Because Large Portion Of Original Codes Cut Down And amp Renders The Valuable Code That Is Need For Optimization Of Mobile Page. 

# 2. Amp Cache :
